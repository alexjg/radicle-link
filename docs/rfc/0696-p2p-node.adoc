== Overview

This RFC expands on the peer-to-peer node outlined in <<rfc-0682, RFC 0682>> to
propose a new stand-alone daemon with focus on driving the p2p stack, exposing a
minimal API and defer supervision to more integrated and mature system services.
Furthermore it will prove that all daemons are made equal and only distinct with
regards to the configuration given (e.g. tracking behaviour) and lifetime of the
process (i.e. socket-activated or long-running).

It also strives to recommend APIs and mechanisms -- in the form of non-core
protocols -- which remove the need for online requests made by clients to a
running node.

== Terminology and Conventions

The key words "`MUST`", "`MUST NOT`", "`REQUIRED`", "`SHALL`", "`SHALL NOT`",
"`SHOULD`", "`SHOULD NOT`", "`RECOMMENDED`", "`NOT RECOMMENDED`", "`MAY`", and
"`OPTIONAL`" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <<RFC2119>>
and <<RFC8174>> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

CBOR <<RFC8949>> datatype definitions are given using the notation devised in
CDDL <<RFC8610>>. By convention, `struct`-like datatypes are encoded as CBOR
maps, where the map key is the zero-based numeric index of the field in
declaration order.

== Protocols

The main purpose of the node is to operate the core protocol of link currently
implemented in `librad::net::peer`, which currently consists of holding onto the
futures du jour and dropping them at opportune moments. Furthermore all
information in form of synchrounous calls and events obtainable internally via
the sufficiently space-engineered tincans SHALL be made available.

Besides the core protocol other functionality will be encapsulated in protocols
which will be driven by a stream of well-defined inputs. The well-defined
outputs of these protocols are used for effect management.

=== Subroutines

This section expands on the auxiliary routines driven by the node on top of the
core protocol. Where each SHOULD be allowed to be disabled through configuration.
A subroutine acts as a reactor driving a protocol by feeding inputs - usually
results of effects (i/o, timers, etc.) - to it and capturing the outputs to
schedule new effects (i/o, timers, etc.).

==== Public RPC API

For other processes to be able to talk to the node, it SHALL keep an API
subroutine running, which offers introspection into its state. See the dedicated
section for the surface the node will expose.

==== Event API

Other processes may be interested in events that occur as the node is running
(for example, that new changes for a tracked identity have been discovered). The
p2p node exposes a read only feed of such events on a local socket.

==== Announcements

Until superseded by <<pr-653, graftier ways>>, currently the main means of
dissemination is through gossiping new interesting `Have`s. When exactly these
announcements should occur is still subject to experimentation. To avoid
coupling these experiments to the p2p node implementation the p2p node exposes
an RPC method which causes the node to announce new changes.

Additionally the node SHALL maintain a persisted view on the list of identities
and their current refs. During periodic runs a delta is created which serves as
the basis of the announcements. In turn that list is made known to actively
connected peers via the core protocols gossip.

The delta mechanism works by recording a snapshot of the state of the monorepo,
specifically the refs, and on the next iteration diffing against the current
state. Relevant refs from that diff can be used to announce or perform other
periodic tasks.

==== Replication Requests

The core protocol implicitly tracks projects after replication, and explicitly
with the `track` operation for remotes in the context of a `Urn`. To enable
changes to the storage to be picked up at any point the node is running and
online, this subroutine will maintain a persisted view and periodically
(potentially provoked by a request over the <<API>>) build the delta for new
tracked `Urn`s and remotes in their context.

Note: A blocking issue for that is
https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-link/issues/141[#141]

==== Tracking

Given the ability to configure a set of urn, peers, both or anything observed
from connected peers, the node will automatically track and replicate. This
strategy is currently in use in the seed node and SHALL be preserved.

== API

=== IPC

[#socket-locations]
==== Socket Locations

All communication with daemon processes SHALL occur over UNIX domain sockets in
`SOCK_STREAM` mode. Peer to peer nodes MAY provide configuration options to
specify where the RPC sockets should be created. If started without
configuration peer to peer nodes MUST create sockets in the following
directory:

* macos:: `/tmp`
* linux:: `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` or `/var/run` if `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is not defined
* windows:: Wherever https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-gettemppatha[`GetTempPathA`] returns

In this directory a peer to peer node MUST create the following sockets

* `link-peer-<peer id>-rpc.socket`:: The RPC socket
* `link-peer-<peer id>-events.socket`:: The event API socket

Where `peer id` is the default base32-z encoding of the peer ID.

==== Wire format

RPC calls over these sockets use <<cbor, CBOR>> for their payload encoding. As
incremental decoders are not available on all platforms, CBOR-encoded messages
shall be prepended by their length in bytes, encoded as a 32-bit unsigned
integer in network byte order.

RPC messages are wrapped in either a `request` or `response` envelope structure
as defined below:

[source,cddl]
----
request = [
    request-headers,
    ? payload: bstr,
]
response = [
    response-headers,
    ? payload: bstr,
]
request-headers = [
    ua: client-id,
    kind: request-kind,
    request-mode: request-mode,
    ? token: token,
]
response-headers = [
    rq: request-id,
    kind: response-kind
]
request-kind = &(
    announce: 1, 
    get-connected-peers: 2,
    get-membership-info: 3,
    get-stats: 4,
)
request-mode = &(
    fire-and-forget: 1,
    report-progress: 2,
)
response-kind = &(
    ack: 1,
    success: 2,
    error: 3,
    progress: 4,
)
; Unambiguous, human-readable string identifying the client application. Mainly
; for diagnostic purposes. Example: "radicle-link-cli/v1.2+deaf"
client-id: tstr .size (4..16)
; Request identifier, choosen by the server.  Note that streaming /
; multi-valued responses may include the same id in several response messages.
request-id: bstr .size (4..16)
; Placeholder for future one-time-token support.
token: bstr

; Canonical representation of a peer. Not used here but referenced in the
; payload specifications for different response kinds
peer-id: bstr
----

All types representing requests and responses and their serialisation logic MUST
be exposed as linkable libraries. It is RECOMMENDED to also expose the
functionality to communicate with the node via IPC as a library.


==== Interaction

Clients MUST wait for a message with an `ack` response kind after sending each
message and before sending the next message. The `request-id` in the headers of
the `ack` response will be used by the server to send any further responses to
the same request.

If the `request-mode` header is set to `fire-and-forget` then the server will
only return an `ack` response. If the header is set to `report-progress` then
the server MAY send response messages with response-kind `progress` during the
processing of the request and MUST send a message with either a `success` or
`error` response kind when the request is finished processing. Once a `success`
or `error` response has been sent the server MUST NOT send any further messages
with the same `request-id` header. The payload of the response messages will
vary depending on the `request-kind`. 

Response messages for concurrent requests may be sent in any order.

For messages with request kind `progress` or `error` the message payload is
always a `tstr` containing a human readable description of the respective
progress or error.


=== Request/Response payloads

Each `request-kind` header implies a different possible `success` payload.

==== `announce`

The success payload is empty

==== `get-connected-peers`

[source,cddl]
----
payload = [* peer-id]
----

==== `get-membership-info`

[source,cddl]
----
payload = -info = {
  active: [* peer-id],
  passive: [* peer-id],
}
----

==== `get-stats`

[source,cddl]
----
payload = {
  "connections-total": uint,
  "membership-active": uint,
  "membership-passive": uint,
  * tstr => any
}
----

== Operations

=== Supervision

Process supervision SHOULD be deferred to established system level service
managers i.e. `<<systemd>>` and `<<launchd>>` for Linux and macOS respectively.
To support both long-running as well as ad-hoc usage the daemon implementation
SHALL be equipped with the ability to detect and read the information from its
environment necessary to determine if it has been activated via socket. When
binding to a socket it SHALL use the file descriptors provided by the init
process. If none are provided it SHALL assume long-running operation and SHALL
bind to the well-known path defined in <<socket-locations>>

Both service managers offer support to fullfil the legacy `inetd` interface.
Which is deemed insufficient for concerns over security, lack of support for
UNIX domain sockets and the design focusing on a process per connection.

==== systemd

Socket activation under systemd is passed on via: 

* `LISTEN_PID` - MUST be equal to the PID of the daemon.
* `LISTEN_FDS` - Number of received file descriptors, starting at 3.
* `LISTEN_NAMES` - Contains colon-separated list of names corresponding to the
  `FileDescriptorName` option in the service file.

==== launchd

* `LAUNCH_DAEMON_SOCKET_NAME` - Name of the socket according to the `.plist`
  configuration file.

The name passed to the process MUST be used to check-in with launchd as
documented in `launch(3)` which in essence involves obtaining the FDs via
`launch_activate_socket` expecting a name.

=== Configuration

Common service configuration files SHALL be provided alongside the source code
of the node binary. To support the semi-dynamic nature of one process per
profile, facilities to manage services with both systemd and launchd SHALL be
provided through the CLI and automated together with the profile lifecycle
management.

The binary SHALL expose all knobs necessary to fine-tune the internal configs of
the core protocol, i.e. `membership`, `protocol`, `storage`. Additionally,
any switches and configuration that subroutines require. The configuration surface
SHALL be exposed as command line arguments, until further evidence is brought
forward which makes a strong case for external config files.

== Key Access

Access to key material SHALL be done through the facilities provided by
`<<radicle-keystore>>`. Except for debug/development purpose this SHOULD be
limited to the use of the `ssh-agent`.

The author assumes that the `rad` CLI provides functionality to manage keys on a
per profile basis including adding them to a running ssh-agent.

== Future Work

Originally this document included a section outlining PubSub solutions. As it
affects too many other parts of the overall architecture, specifying it will be
deferred to a follow-up RFC.

Developers! Developers! Developers! - or how nobody knows what to do with
Windows. While solutions like WSL are present, it's unclear at this point how/if
a native solution could look like.
