== Motivation

There may be many processes which are interested in changes made to a link
monorepo. We would like to define a standard way for applications to notify each
other about changes to the monorepo.

== Terminology and Conventions

The key words "`MUST`", "`MUST NOT`", "`REQUIRED`", "`SHALL`", "`SHALL NOT`",
"`SHOULD`", "`SHOULD NOT`", "`RECOMMENDED`", "`NOT RECOMMENDED`", "`MAY`", and
"`OPTIONAL`" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <<RFC2119,
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119>> and <<RFC8174,
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174>> when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

== Hooks

Notifications of changes in the storage are delivered via "hooks", which are
similar in spirit to git hooks. A hook is an executable placed in
`<MONOREPO_DIR>/hooks/<hook type>`, where `hook type` is a directory named one
of:

* `urn_changed`
* `tracking_changed`

=== Calling a hook

For each hook type the notifying process MUST iterate over each executable in
the hook directory and call the executable with the arguments specified in this
document. 

Hook processes MUST continue to process events until they receive an end of
transmission character encoded as `0x04`. This allows calling processes to
start a hook process once and then keep the process running until they need to
notify it again.

== Event Types

There are two event types

* Notifications that the data under a URN has changed in some way
* Notifications that the tracking config for a URN has changed

In both cases notifications are sent as a best effort and applications MUST NOT
assume that the current on-disk state matches the notification.

=== URN changed hook

Whenever a process makes a change that updates a ref under
`refs/namespaces/<URN>/` the process MUST invoke the `urn_changed` hooks. The
hook argument is the following:

[source]
----
'rad:git' <urn> [<ref path>] SP <old-oid> SP <new-oid> LF
----

Where 
* `<urn>` is the base32-z encoding of the URN
* `<ref path>` is the ref in the scope of the URN namespace. I.e. everything
  after `refs/namespaces/<URN>/`. 
* `<old-oid>` is the OID the ref previously pointed at, this will be the zero OID
  if the ref is being created
* `<new-oid>` is the OID the ref previously pointed at, this will be the zero OID
  if the ref is being deleted
* `SP` is a single space character
* `LF` is `\n`

Note that the `ref-path` is optional and if it is empty then the notification
refers to the entire namespace. Thus detecting newly created URNs is a question
of waiting for notifications with an empty ref path and a non-zero `new-oid`.

=== Tracking changed hook

Whenever a process updates a ref under `refs/namespaces/<URN>/(default | <peer
id>)` the process MUST invoke the `tracking_changed` hooks. The hook argument is


[source]
----
'rad:git' <urn> SP <peer-id> SP <old-oid> SP <new-oid> LF
----

Where
* `<urn>` is the base32-z encoding of the URN
* `<peer-id>` is either a peer ID or the string `default`.
* `<old-oid>` is the OID of the previous tracking entry blob, this will be the zero
  OID if the tracking entry is being created
* `<new-oid>` is the OID of the new tracking entry blob, this will be the zero
  OID if the tracking entry is being deleted
* `SP` is a single space character
* `LF` is `\n`
