//! This module is the client interface to the p2p node RPC API. The APIs here
//! are designed to work in both an asynchronous and synchronous context. To
//! start you'll need to create a [`Connection`] by calling either
//! [`Connection::connect`] or [`Connection::connect_async`]. Once you have a
//! connection you then create a command using the `commands::*` functions. A
//! command then has various methods on it which determine exactly how the
//! command should be executed.
//!
//! See the documentation of [`Command`] for more information.
